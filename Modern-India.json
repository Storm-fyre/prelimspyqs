        "explanation": "The Rakhmabai case of 1884 was a landmark legal case. Rakhmabai, married in childhood, refused to live with her husband, leading him to sue for 'restitution of conjugal rights'. The case brought the issues of child marriage, the 'age of consent' for consummation, and a woman's right to choose to the forefront of public debate. While Rakhmabai later studied medicine, her right to education was not the central legal issue of the 1884 case itself.

It demonstrated the power of Satyagraha and firmly linked the agrarian struggles with the quest for Swaraj.",

The award proposed separate electorates not only for Muslims, Sikhs, etc., but also for the Depressed Classes (Dalits). Gandhi viewed this as a move to divide Hindu society and began the fast to have the provision for the Depressed Classes removed. This led to the Poona Pact.",

Under this system, there were no intermediaries like zamindars; the individual cultivator (ryot) was the proprietor and paid the land revenue directly to the state.\n2. The government issued a 'patta' or title deed to the ryot, which specified the area of land and the revenue to be paid.\n3.

        "explanation": "The increased litigation after the Permanent Settlement (1793) is traced to a combination of factors not fully captured by options A, B, or C. The primary reason was the formalization and recording of rights, rents, and jurisdictions, which were previously based on custom. This new legalistic framework encouraged all parties\u2014zamindars, ryots, and the state\u2014to turn to the newly established courts to settle disputes over land rights and rent payments. While the judicial system was made more structured, it was the application of this formal system to complex, customary land relations that spurred litigation.",

This disruption was a result of colonial policies that included the introduction of new land revenue systems (A), the influx of outsiders like moneylenders and traders (C), and the imposition of forest laws.

The Kheda Satyagraha of 1918 was launched because the peasants of the Kheda district in Gujarat were suffering from a severe crop failure due to drought. According to the revenue code, if the yield was less than one-fourth of the normal produce, the peasants were entitled to a remission.
